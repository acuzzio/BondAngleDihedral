This is a simple routine to extract Bonds Angles and Dihedral from xyz formatted geometry or dynamics files


This scripts works with 2, 3 or 4 argouments.
You have to launch it in a folder that contains xyz geometry or dynamics files and then give the index of 2,3 or 4 atoms.
Example:

 $ runhaskell BondAngleDihedral.hs 1 2  <- will give the bond length between atoms 1 and 2
 $ runhaskell BondAngleDihedral.hs 4 2 6   <- will give the angle between atoms 4,2 and 6
 $ runhaskell BondAngleDihedral.hs 4 2 6 10 <- will give the dihedral between atoms 4 2 6 and 10
