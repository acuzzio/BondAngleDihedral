This is a simple routine to extract Bonds Angles and Dihedral from xyz formatted geometry or dynamics files


This scripts works with 2, 3 or 4 argouments.
You have to launch it in a folder that contains xyz geometry or dynamics files and then give the index of 2,3 or 4 atoms.

to install (you can use sandboxes just using cabal-dev instead of cabal):

 $ git clone git@github.com:acuzzio/BondAngleDihedral.git
 $ cd BondAngleDihedral/
 $ cabal configure
 $ cabal install missing_packages
 $ cabal build
 $ cp dist/build/BondAngleDihedral/BondAngleDihedral a_path_folder/

Example:

 $ BondAngleDihedral 1 2         <- will give the bond length between atoms 1 and 2
 $ BondAngleDihedral 4 2 6       <- will give the angle between atoms 4,2 and 6
 $ BondAngleDihedral 4 2 6 10    <- will give the dihedral between atoms 4 2 6 and 10



Enjoy !!!
